When a user signs up, give them the option to send in a note.
This could be useful if an event requires different types of volunteers, and the user would like to sign up for a specific type of job.

Add a mandatory short description field to events so they are easier to list and display, as well as search. We could put keywords in the
short description field. Alternatively, the title might be a good enough short description since most staff will know what the event is just
by looking at the title.

Add event search filtering criteria for the event index page
	+ Expired/not expired
	+ By year

Sort the event index page the way the user wants (date published, date of event, ascending, descending, etc...)

Have an interface where the user can search events by categories organized by years

Make the user profile page more lively.
	Add profile pictures

Monthly cron job that will remind users of their yearly chaperone obligations

Weekly cron job that reminds users of events that they've already signed up for 

Daily cron job that reminds users of events that they've signed up for starting two days before the event

Cron job alerts - email/text/call ? combination?

Bash installation script for the intranet, installs dependencies, pulls code from github, apache, mod_wsgi, django, markdown, django_auth_ldap, bootstrap, server settings, etc
	* "A developer's job is to put himself/herself out of work"

Future app ideas? Make sure there's room for future expansion

On the "sign someone up" form on the eventPage, add a search feature. There will be a lot of teachers and it will be a hassle to go down the list until you find the right one.
Or at least alphabetize the users by last name, and remove the users that are already signed up from the list.

BUG: When a user registers for an event, their eventsNeeded field should decrease by 1.
	Inversely, when the deregister, their eventsNeeded field should increase by 1.
