Hello {% firstof user.first_name user.username %}!

As a faculty member of Bishop Blanchet High school, you probably know that
you are required to chaperone for at least 4 events every school year.
This service is vital to our community, and we value your participation.

We just want to remind you that our records indicate that you have completed
{{ user.get_profile.eventsCompleted }} out of 4 events of your yearly event 
chaperone obligation.

You have {{ user.get_profile.daysLeft }} remaining days to fulfill your
obligation before the end of the school year.

Here are the 5 nearest future events:
		{% for event in events %}
		+ {{ event.name }} (http://faculty.bishopblanchet.org{{ event.get_absolute_url }})
		{% endfor %}

In order to gain access to the chaperone website, be sure to sign in with the same credentials
you would use to log on to a computer at school.

Please take a look at http://faculty.bishopblanchet.org/chaperone
for more events that you can now sign up for online.
