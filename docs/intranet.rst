What is it?
=======================================

The intranet is an internal web service designed for use by the Bishop Blanchet Staff.

Any BBHS faculty member or BBHS school administrator can log in and use the
site with their existing school username and password.

The idea is that within the intranet, there are several "apps" that can be used
by staff members. Right now, we only have a chaperone app, but we are
looking at expanding the intranet with more apps in the future.

Types of users
==============

There are primarily two types of users in the intranet.

Any other kind of user is app-specific, but falls within the following two
categories:

Super user
----------

A super user has full permissions to access the admin page, and they can add,
remove, or modify any object in the database.

Additionally, a super user has full permissions to do any app-specific actions.

Regular user
------------

Globally, a regular user only has permission to login to the intranet with
their LDAP credentials. The only people who can login are those that are
included in the Staff security group.

A regular user may have further bare-minimum permissions that are specific to
the apps of the intranet.
