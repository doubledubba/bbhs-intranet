   contain the root `toctree` directive.

What is it?
=======================================

The intranet is an internal web service designed for use by the Bishop Blanchet Staff.

Any BBHS faculty member or BBHS school administrator can log in and use the
site with their existing school username and password.

The idea is that within the intranet, there are several "apps" that can be used
by staff members. Right now, we only have a chaperone app, but we are
looking at expanding the intranet with more apps in the future.

Chaperone App
=============

The chaperone app was created to replace an existing system for managing school
events and their volunteers.

There are 4 main types of users in this app:
    * Super users - they have absolute permission to do anything (tech office)
    * Site Administrators - they have permission to do almost anything behind
      the scenes
      (activities office)
    * Event Administrators - they are allowed to administrate events
    * Staff - the regular user, can sign up for events

Site administrators can create events that the rest of the community will be
able to see and register for online.

Each event has a single event administrator, that is set initially by the site
administrator that created the event (this can be changed by a site admin
later).

The event admin's contact info will be posted on the event's description page,
as well as a list of all of the other users who have signed up for the event.
This is safe, because only logged-in users can see this information.

Event administrators can
  * Send emails to the whole BBHS faculty to request volunteers
  * Send email reminders to the event's signed up users
  * See the public notes and the private notes that users post on the event's
    page
  * Sign up other users directly for the event
  * Remove other volunteers from the event's registration
